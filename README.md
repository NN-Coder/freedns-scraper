Steps:
1. Download ChromeDriver at https://googlechromelabs.github.io/chrome-for-testing/
2. Download Selenium with pip3 install selenium
3. Download main.py from this github repository
4. Edit and save main.py by setting "____" with your ChromeDriver path
5. Run main.py with python main.py
6. A .txt file will be created in the same directory as main.py, you can open it with cat public_domains.txt or double click it from file explorer/finder
7. If you would prefer the output file to be in a JSON format instead, use json-version.py in place of main.py
